HTML is not difficult to wrangle. Read through the comments (like this one!) to learn how to edit the page below.
============================================================================ -->

<!--
Let's get started.

1) READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of this tag for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but instead is just text comments about the code. For this project, the comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding of what you are being asked to do.

2) GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. Click on the tags in the code on this side of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

<html>

<!--
You might notice some words on this page (like <body> and <h1>) which are inside of angle brackets and colored blue.

These words are called tags. Tags help you to structure your page. For example, let's say that you want to make a paragraph. You will put a tag at the exact point you want the paragraph to start and another tag where you want the paragraph to stop. The most important thing to remember is that tags (with a few exceptions, like <img>) come in pairs - so you almost always need to have an opening and closing tag.

The <body> tag below contains the actual content of your webpage. Everything a visitor sees will be written inside this tag.
-->

  <body>

<!--
Below this comment is a heading. The <h1> tag stands for header - and everything inside the <h1> tag becomes a big header on the preview to the right. <h1> opens the tag, and </h1> closes it. Everything in between is the heading.
-->

    <h1>An important heading</h1>

<!--
Below this comment is another heading. <h2> is similar to <h1>, but it's more like a sub-heading.

Try changing the words inside of the <h1> and <h2> blue tags above and below this comment. Watch what happens to the preview on the right.
-->

    <h2>A sub-heading</h2>

<!--
The <p> tag below stands for paragraph and is one of the most commonly used elements in HTML. We use it to write exactly what you would expect, paragraphs of text. Try editing the paragraphs, or even adding one or two more. Just remember to have both opening and closing paragraph tags like <p> this </p> around each paragraph.
-->

    <p>Look! I am writing HTML!</p>
    <p>Here's another paragraph.</p>
    <p>Here's another <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">paragraph</a>.</p>

<!--
Notice that the last two paragraphs above look very similar on the page, but there is one slight difference. In the last one, the word, paragraph is hyperlinked. That's because we are using the <a> tag which is arguably the most important tag in HTML. It handles hyperlinks and comes with a required attribute: href. You use href to specify the URL you want the text or object linked to. Above you see its linked to Mozilla's site, you can replace the URL in the quotes with one of your own. Remember you need the quotes, and you also need the full URL (http://www.example.com). The text between the open <a> and close </a> is what shows up on the page as linked text. Try changing the text and notice how it changes on the page on the right.

  </body>

Congratulations! You've wrangled some HTML. This may have seemed simplistic but the good news is that these tags are used over and over again in HTML. Now that you know how to use basic HTML, you are ready to dive into some of the other projects!
