  Thimble makes it easy to work with HTML and CSS, the building blocks of the web, even if you've never done it before. Just type on the left, then see what the finished page will look like on the right. Thimble also helps check your work as you go, providing a simple "spell check" for code to help you spot and squash errors instantly.

        Mozilla is a non-profit that believes everyone should be able to make and share with the open web. But creating, hosting or tweaking your own stuff is often still too difficult&mdash;with obstacles like learning HTML and CSS, struggling with servers to preview your work, or figuring out where your content will live online. Thimble clears away those barriers, making it easier to create your own projects quickly and learn web skills in a way that's easy, visual and fun.
