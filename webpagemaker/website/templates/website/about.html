          Thimble makes it easy to work with HTML and CSS, the building
          blocks of the web, even if you&rsquo;ve never done it before. Just
          type on the left, then see what the finished page will look
          like on the right. Thimble also helps check your work as you
          go, providing a simple &ldquo;spell&rdquo; check for code to help you spot
          and squash errors instantly.

          Mozilla is a non-profit that believes everyone should be able
          to make and share with the open web. But creating, hosting or
          tweaking your own stuff is often still too
          difficult&mdash;with obstacles like learning HTML and CSS,
          struggling with servers to preview your work, or figuring out
          where your content will live online. Thimble clears away those
          barriers, making it easier to create your own projects quickly
          and learn web skills in a way that&rsquo;s easy, visual and
          fun.
